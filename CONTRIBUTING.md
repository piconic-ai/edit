# Contributing to pedit

Bug reports, documentation improvements and pull requests are welcome.
[Open an issue](https://github.com/piconic-ai/pedit/issues) with steps to reproduce,
your OS, pedit version and expected behavior. Remove room links, keys, Access
tokens and private document content from reports.
Report security vulnerabilities privately as described in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in a public issue.

For a substantial change, open an issue to discuss the approach first. Keep pull
requests focused, describe the resulting behavior and include how you verified it.
Add regression tests for behavior changes and run the checks below before submitting.

## Development

Requires Go 1.25+, Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10.7.1 (see `go.mod` and `package.json`).

The CLI is written in Go; the server and the browser editor in TypeScript.
`packages/` is a standalone pnpm workspace for the relay and browser editor.
Root scripts forward to it; `pnpm install` installs its locked dependencies.
For filtered commands, use `pnpm --dir packages --filter <package> ...`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm test        # TypeScript packages
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test:deploy # self-host deployment orchestration
PEDIT_INTEROP=1 go test -race ./...    # the CLI; its interop test drives the web client's RoomClient with Node.js
go vet ./...
```

Run everything locally:

```sh
pnpm --dir packages --filter @pedit/worker dev                  # builds the web editor, serves on http://localhost:8787
printf '# Notes\n' > /tmp/pedit-dev-notes.md
# Set server: http://localhost:8787 in .pedit/config.yaml
go run ./cmd/pedit /tmp/pedit-dev-notes.md
```

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/pedit`, `internal/` | The `pedit` command (Go). `internal/protocol` mirrors `packages/protocol` on top of [ygo](https://github.com/reearth/ygo) |
| `packages/` | Standalone server workspace, self-host config and deployment scripts |
| `packages/protocol` | Encryption, message framing and the Yjs room client used by the web editor |
| `packages/worker` | Hono Worker + `Room` Durable Object (WebSocket Hibernation API); also serves the web editor |
| `packages/web` | CodeMirror 6 editor for collaborators; UI components in BarefootJS |

The wire format (AES-GCM frames, message types, y-protocols sync and awareness)
is shared by both implementations: change them together.

- A frame is `iv || AES-GCM(room key, type || payload)`. Types: `0` sync, `1`
  awareness, `2` attachment, `3` canvas. Clients skip types they do not know,
  so newer peers can add more.
- Clients offer the protocol version as the WebSocket subprotocol `pedit-v<N>`
  (`PROTOCOL_VERSION` in `packages/protocol`, `ProtocolVersion` in
  `internal/protocol`). The Room turns another version away with close code
  `4002` (the client is older) or `4003` (the server is older), and clients
  stop reconnecting and ask to update pedit or reload the page.
- Other close codes the Room sends and clients do not reconnect on: `4001`
  (the host left and the session is over) and `4004` (the room already has as
  many guests as the relay allows).
- While pedit is 0.x, patch releases keep the wire format compatible. Additive
  changes (a new message type or kind that older peers skip) do not change the
  version. A change older peers cannot skip bumps the version, ships in a minor
  release and is noted in the CHANGELOG.
- Attachments (images) are named by content: `hash` is the first 128 bits of
  SHA-256 of the bytes, in hex. Their bytes are encrypted with a key derived
  from the room key (HKDF-SHA256, info `pedit blob enc v1`) and stored under
  `blobId`, the first 128 bits of HMAC-SHA256 over `hash` with another derived
  key (info `pedit blob id v1`), in base64url. The server sees neither the
  content nor its hash.
- Attachment messages carry a lib0 varint kind and fields: `0` announce
  (hash, mime), `1` want (hashes), `2` stored (hash, path), `3` rejected
  (hash, reason). `packages/testdata/blob-vectors.json` pins the
  derivations for both implementations.

Before opening a pull request, also run `pnpm build` and check Go formatting with
`gofmt -l cmd internal` (it should print nothing). The interop tests require the
installed TypeScript dependencies; `PEDIT_INTEROP=1` prevents silently skipping them.

Keep encryption keys in the URL fragment and keep document content on clients.
