# Room admission protocol

The room ID is routing metadata visible to the relay and to request logs. A
client must also present a capability derived from the room key before it
can occupy a WebSocket slot or read/write encrypted attachments. This keeps
someone who knows only the ID from exhausting a room's peer or blob quota.

## Derivation and transport

Both Go and TypeScript derive 32 bytes with HKDF-SHA256: input key material
is the decoded 32-byte room key, salt is empty, and info is the UTF-8 string
`pedit admission v1`. Encode the output as unpadded base64url (43 characters).
The dedicated info string separates this capability from the AES-GCM frame
key and both attachment keys. Never send the room key or reuse an encryption
key as the capability.

WebSocket clients offer two subprotocols:

```text
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: pedit-v1, pedit-admission.<token>
```

The server selects only `pedit-v1`, never echoes the capability, and rejects
missing, malformed, or multiple admission tokens. Browsers use the standard
WebSocket protocols argument; the Go client uses its handshake options.
Blob GET and PUT requests send `X-Pedit-Admission: <token>`. The capability
never appears in a path, query string, response body, or application log.
Custom infrastructure must redact these request headers.

## Registration and lifetime

The Worker still validates the host's independent bearer token against the
room ID and strips caller-supplied `X-Pedit-Host`. Only a verified host can
register an admission verifier in the Durable Object. The verifier is
SHA-256 of the admission token's UTF-8 representation; it is persisted in
SQLite KV and checked with Workers' constant-time `timingSafeEqual`.
Concurrent handshakes read the verifier after hashing, and cannot change it
while the session exists. No token/key verifier can be installed by a guest
or a blob request.

Admission precedes peer-slot allocation and R2/quota operations. A guest
connecting to a closed room with a syntactically valid admission protocol
still receives close code 4001, without obtaining a hibernating peer slot.
The verifier survives hibernation and is removed with the quota when the
last host leaves. Document updates retain their existing encryption and
wire format. A capability does not confer the host role and does not enable
decryption; possession does allow use of the relay's room resources.

## Compatibility and verification

Update the CLI, relay, and browser bundle together and restart sessions.
Old clients without admission are rejected. Already-open sockets from an
older deployment must be closed as part of the rollout. There is no fallback
to room-ID-only admission.

The Go and TypeScript unit tests use an independently computed HKDF vector.
Worker tests cover invalid/missing tokens, host-header spoofing, unauthorized
blob quota consumption, guest registration attempts, and hibernation. The
Go/JavaScript interoperability server enforces admission and negotiates the
public subprotocol on real WebSockets, including Node's custom-header path.
