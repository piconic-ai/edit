# pedit — Pair edit your local files.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14bec9ab-8c14-495c-8faf-9cdd98d8fd5b

`pedit` is a CLI that lets people edit your local files together in their
browsers. Edits are saved back to your file:

```text
❯ pedit notes.md

  notes.md is ready to write together.

  Send this link to the people you want to invite:
    https://edit.piconic.ai/r/<room-id>#<key>
```

No install or account needed for collaborators on the public server.

Collaborators who would rather stay in their own editor join from the command
line instead. Given the link, `pedit` mirrors the shared file to a temporary
copy and keeps it in sync both ways until they leave or the host closes the
room; the copy is removed then, like closing a browser tab:

```text
❯ pedit 'https://edit.piconic.ai/r/<room-id>#<key>'

  Joined. Your copy of the shared file:
    /tmp/pedit-<room-id>-2271/notes.md
    Copied to your clipboard.

  Edit it with any editor; changes sync both ways while you are in the room.
  Press Ctrl+C to leave. The copy is temporary and removed then; -d <dir> keeps one.
```

Quote the link in the shell: `#` starts a comment otherwise. `-d <dir>` keeps
the copy in that directory instead, where `pedit` refuses to overwrite a file
already there. Canvas rooms can only be joined in a browser for now.

## Why pedit?

Local files work naturally with coding agents and your own editor. Keeping
documents in Git makes changes reviewable and preserves their history, but
asking someone to clone a repository and open a pull request adds friction
to a quick editing session.

pedit lets you invite people into the file with a link and edit together in
their browsers. They do not need to set up your development environment.
The edits land in the same local file, ready for your next agent task,
review or commit.

## Install

macOS / Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://edit.piconic.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Homebrew (macOS / Linux):

```sh
brew install piconic-ai/tap/pedit
```

mise:

```sh
mise use -g github:piconic-ai/edit
```

Go 1.25+:

```sh
go install github.com/piconic-ai/edit/cmd/pedit@latest
```

Binaries: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/piconic-ai/edit/releases) (macOS / Linux / Windows · amd64 / arm64).

## Configuration and templates

Run `pedit` at a Git repository root to create `.pedit/config.yaml` and
`.pedit/templates/` with editable Markdown, CSV, and Canvas defaults.

```yaml
server: https://edit.piconic.ai
output: notes
```

Add your own template files directly to `.pedit/templates/`:

```sh
pedit                          # notes/pedit-<time>.md
pedit --csv                    # notes/pedit-<time>.csv
pedit --canvas                 # notes/pedit-<time>.canvas
pedit -t minutes.md             # notes/minutes-<time>.md
pedit -t minutes.md -d meetings # meetings/minutes-<time>.md
```

`.canvas` files use [JSON Canvas](https://jsoncanvas.org/), an open format for
whiteboard-style diagrams.

`-t` / `--template` selects a template; `-t csv` and `-t canvas` select
`default.csv` and `default.canvas`. `-d` / `--directory` overrides `output`.
New files get a timestamp and a counter if needed. Existing files are preserved.

Configuration is found from the current directory up to the Git root.
`output` is relative to the project; `-d` is relative to the current directory.
Without configuration, the public server and built-in defaults work immediately.
Set `server` in the config instead of `PEDIT_SERVER`.

## Privacy and security

![The browser encrypts Text. Cloudflare relays Encrypted Text to pedit CLI, which decrypts it and saves Text to local notes.md. The URL path identifies the room; its fragment contains the shared key, which is never sent to the server.](docs/assets/encryption-sequence.svg)

This is a simplified illustration: pedit encrypts document updates rather than
raw text. The relay sees the room ID and encrypted bytes, but not the key.
Edits in the opposite direction follow the same process.

- **End-to-end encryption.** Document updates and pasted images are encrypted
  on your devices. The relay receives ciphertext; the key stays in the link's
  `#fragment` and is never sent to the server.
- **Local files, temporary sessions.** The relay does not store document text.
  The relay attempts to delete encrypted images when the host leaves; a
  one-day bucket lifecycle rule handles failed deletions. Removal is not immediate.
- **Private local copies.** On Unix, new CLI join copies and saved attachments
  use owner-only permissions, further restricted by your umask. Updates retain
  an existing document's permissions; existing files are not retroactively made private.
- **The link grants editing access.** Anyone with the full link can read and
  edit during the session. Share it only with people you trust. Closing a
  session does not erase copies participants have made.
- **Room IDs alone do not grant access.** Clients derive a separate admission
  token from the fragment key. The relay checks this token before accepting
  connections or attachment requests; the token cannot decrypt content.
- **Your relay, your access rules.** Use the public relay at `edit.piconic.ai`,
  or [self-host](#self-host) to require sign-in with Cloudflare Access.

You must trust the relay operator to serve the intended browser editor, and
trust participant devices and browsers. A modified editor could read the key
and plaintext. Infrastructure can see IP addresses, room IDs, request timing
and ciphertext sizes; infrastructure and Access logs have separate retention
settings and are not erased when a room closes.

Markdown previews can request external images, videos and embeds. With Access,
avatars may load from an identity provider or Gravatar using an email hash.
Those providers can see the requests.

## Self-host

Self-host when you want to limit who can join editing sessions. Cloudflare
Access lets you allow specific email addresses or identity provider groups;
participants need both an allowed identity and the session link.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpiconic-ai%2Fedit%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fpackages)

The button copies only the server workspace (`packages/`), without the Go CLI.
Deploy the relay and browser editor to your Cloudflare account, then:

```sh
# Set server: https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev in .pedit/config.yaml
pedit notes.md
```

See [self-hosting notes](docs/self-hosting.md) for requirements and Access setup.
